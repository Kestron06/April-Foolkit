# April-Foolkit
A Discord bot toolkit for miscellaneous Discord pranks.

## Current Pranks
- Shuffling the names of all users in the server

## Planned Pranks
- Kaepora Gaebora, halts users every so many messages to warn them of the dangers of the wild and won't let them continue posting until this is completed.
- Channel name shuffling
- Automatic fake ping icon generation

## Running Locally
You'll need Node.js installed, and to run `npm i` in the bot's directory to install the dependencies. Initialize a file named `storage.json` and put `{}` as its contents. You'll also need to initialize a file named `env.json` and put your bot's token in it like so.
```json
{
  "token":"YOUR BOT'S TOKEN HERE"
}```
